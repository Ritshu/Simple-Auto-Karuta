# Simple-Auto-KarutaBot
## DISCLAIMER
I don't take any responsibility for blocked Discord accounts that used this cheat. If you try to use it, you'll either get banned from Discord, because self-bots are against the TOS, or you'll be banned from the Karuta bot.
I had never gain profit from the selling of this software and I'm posting it just to display something on my GitHub.
I enjoyed coding this bot more than playing the actual game, but now that the bot protection is more strict (finally, good for them), I'll stop developing this project. You're free to try it out at your own risk, but I won't explain how to install it: you'll have to figure it out yourself.

## What's Karuta Bot?
Karuta is a collectible card bot powered by Discord that currently features more than 90,000 anime characters. It turns these characters into unique collectibles that you can earn, customize, upgrade, trade, and more!
For more info check [their page at top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/646937666251915264).

## How it works?
Given a bunch of discord user token and 2 channels (one to drop and one to check cooldowns) for each token, you can run multiple accounts to farm cards and items.

## How do I set it up?
You'll have to dig the code if you really want to use it.

## What commands can I use?
Again, you'll have to dig the code a bit.

If you have questions, text me on Discord: Ritshu#0228. I check the dm only once in a while. **I won't explain how it works or how to use it**.
